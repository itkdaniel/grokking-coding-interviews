##   Merge Intervals
##
##   Problem Statement
"""
##   We are given an array of closed intervals, intervals, where each interval 
##   has a start time and an end time. The input array is sorted with respect to 
##   the start times of each interval. For example, intervals 
##   = [[1,4],[3,6],[7,9]] is sorted in terms of start times 1, 3, and 7.
##   Your task is to **merge** the __overlapping_intervals__ and return a new 
##   output array consisting of only the non-overlapping intervals.
##
##   Constraints:
##   * 1 <= intervals.length <= 10^4
##   * intervals[i].length = 2
##   * 0 <= start time <= end time <= 10^4
##
##   Example 1:
##   Input: [[1,5],[3,7],[4,6],[6,8]]
##   Ouput: [1,8]
##   Explanation: Intervals [1,5], [3,7], [4,6], [6,8] are overlapping.
##                Merge them to one interval [1,8].
##   
##   Example 2:
##   Input: [[10,12],[12,15]]
##   Output: [10,15]
##   Explanation: Intervals [10,12],[12,15] are overlapping
##                Merge them to one interval [10,15]
##
##   Example 3:
##   Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18],[18,20]]
##   Output: [1,6],[8,10],[15,20]
##   Explanation: Intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap and are merged to [1,6].
##                Intervals [15,18] and [18,20] overlap and are merged to [15,20]

##      with the last interval in the output list, merge these two intervals and 
##      replace the last interval of the output list with this merged interval.

##   Solution Summary
"""
##   The above solution has a time comlexity of O(n), where n is the number of 
##   intervals in the input list. This is because the function has 2 separate 
##   loops that iterate at most the length of the input list. 
##   The first loop manipulates the original input list into a list of the 
##   merged intervals.
##   Then the second loop removes the rest of the intervals that were already 
##   processed, starting from the index of the last merged interval to the end 
##   of the list.
##   
##   The space complexity of the above solution is O(1). This is because the 
##   function manipulates and transforms the original input list into the output 
##   list directly without using any additional data structures.
##
##   Therefore, this is the most efficient solution in terms of time and space 
##   complexity. âœ“
